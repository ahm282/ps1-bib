# Introduction

This application is a web-based tool that provides information about the availability of books. It allows users to browse through books, view their details, and check their availability status.

## System Requirements

Any system that supports the following software can run this application:

-   web server (Apache or Nginx)
-   Python 3.6 or above
-   web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
-   internet connection

## Front-end

To preview the website please ensure you have a web server installed on your system (Apache or Nginx).

### index.html

**Practically empty**, only contains the title and the link to the stylesheet.
All content is generated by the **JavaScript** code.

### style.css

Contains the styling for the website.

### script.js

Contains the JavaScript code to generate the website.

### Recreating the script

1. Retrieve book data from the api_books.json file and availability data from the availability.json file using the fetch() function.
2. Chain the promises using the .then() method to handle the responses and parse the JSON data.
3. Access the books-container element in the HTML using document.querySelector() and store it in the booksContainer variable.
4. Iterate over each book in the books array and create a new div element for each book. Create sub-divs for availability and book information.
5. Create a bookDiv element using document.createElement("div") and add the book-div class to it using classList.add().
6. Extract the book title, author, price and image from the book object and add them to the bookDiv element using innerHTML.
7. Check if book.summary is not null. If true, create a summary element using document.createElement("p"), add the book-summary class to it, and set the textContent to book.summary.
8. If the length of the summary is greater than 200 characters, truncate it and append "..." at the end.
9. Create an availabilityDiv element using document.createElement("div") and add the book-availability class to it using classList.add().
10. Iterate over each location in the book.locations array and create a new div element for each location.
11. Add the book-div class to the book div and append it to the booksContainer.
12. Use event.target.closest(".book-div") to find the closest ancestor element with the class book-div and assign it to the clickedBookDiv variable.
13. If clickedBookDiv exists, use clickedBookDiv.querySelector(".book-info-availability") to find the child element with the class book-info-availability and assign it to the infoAvailabilityDiv variable.
14. Check the visibility of infoAvailabilityDiv. If it is visible, set its visibility style property to "hidden"; otherwise, set it to "visible".

## Future Work
